            <p>The picturesque Gamcheon Culture Village has earned many nicknames, 
                with a few popular ones being “Korea’s Santorini” and “Lego Village.” 
                Originally a poor hillside neighborhood, the village was given its current name in 2009, when Busan’s local residents and artists began refurbishing the entire neighborhood into an art village.
                Rows and rows of small houses closely huddled together along the hillsides, including the empty houses, have been turned into unique works of art to provide cultural and art experiences. Stop by the Haneulmaru Observation Deck for a beautiful panoramic view of the village and an excellent spot to take pictures against the colorful backdrop of the village.

       <p>If you’re interested in Korean culture, then visiting the Lee Hyo-seok Memorial Hall is a must. The hall is designed to show the timeline of Lee Hyo-seok’s literary life. Near the hall is a nature-friendly walking path called the Hyo-seok Literature 100-ri Road, made inspired by the journey of the protagonist of his novel.</p>

        <p>The first thing you will see when exiting Yeosu-Expo Station is the grand-scale Expo Ocean Park right on the coast. The site opened as the venue for the 2012 Yeosu World Expo, and now serves as an exhibition and event site that offers various water sports.
        Of the park’s many facilities, the two that stand out the most are the Big-O and Sky Tower, which was originally a storage space for cement. The exterior of Sky Tower is accented by a gigantic pipe organ, which was included in the Guinness World Records in 2011 as the world’s loudest pipe organ. The observatory offers a panoramic view of Expo Ocean Park and the deep blue ocean fading into the horizon beyond.
        The Big-O is one of the park's finest attractions. At night, the light and water show turns this large ring into a fantastic performance. Take note that the Big-O show does not take place on Mondays or during the winter season.</p>

        <p>Jecheon Oksunbong Suspension Bridge is one of Jecheon's representative tourist destinations along with Uirimji Reservoir, Yongchupokpo Falls Glass Observatory and Cheongpung Cable Car. With a length of 222 meters, a simple walk across the suspension bridge feels like an amusement ride, swaying even with just a small force. Get a thrilling experience with just one look at the floor where you can see clearly below. Jecheon Oksunbong Suspension Bridge, connected with a special plated cable, can withstand the weight of 90 tons at the same time and is designed to withstand winds of 28.3 m/s, so there is no need to worry about safety. The view of Oksunbong Peak from the suspension bridge is superb. At the end of the suspension bridge, there is a trail where you can enjoy the view of Chungjuho Lake while walking along the hillside of Oksunbong Peak.</p>
